# Alter Ego App
The old Alter Ego app from Danganronpa rewritten in the Godot Game Engine.
Unlike the original, this remake can be run on a desktop computer as well as a phone.
English is KINDA supported because I used Google Translate and it did a horrible job.

## App Features
- Alter Ego will give you a greeting depending on time of day or if it is a (Japanese) holiday.
> Left Column of home screen:
- Calendar: Shows current month. You can add stamps from top right by selecting a stamp then choosing a date to add the stamp tool. Use the eraser to erase stamps.
- Clock: Alter Ego will tell you the time (I don't speak japanese, so I'm not sure anything that is said makes sense).
- Freetime: Alter Ego will talk to you about various things.
> Right Column of Home screen:
- Character Encyclopedia: A brief description of each character and their ultimate ability.
- World Encyclopedia: A definition of various terms related to Hope's Peak Academy and the Danganronpa Killing Game.
- Character Diagnosis: Alter Ego will ask you a series of questions to determine which character you are most like
- Help: explains how to use the app
- Language: change the language to English or back to Japanese; I DONT reccomend doing this because the translation is through Google Translate and it was done very poorly.
## Differences Between the Original and Remake
- Remake supports (poorly machine translated) English.
- Freetalk button is now on the left side of screen instead of the right like the original.
- Game does not look EXACTLY the same, but I tried to make it close.
- The original was made with the Unity Game Engine; the remake is made with Godot 4.1.
## Script File
The script (as in list of all dialouge) for the game is found in the lang folder in both jp.txt and en.txt.
If you wish to give the game a proper english translation, translate all of the japanese text in jp.txt to en.txt but don't change any formatting, lest the game will not parse the script.
All fancy left and right brackets are just regular brackets (like so: []) in english. Japanese uses these fancy brackets (like so:【】).
## Copyright
The original game was made by Spike Chunsoft. I don't own the images or characters in this game.
